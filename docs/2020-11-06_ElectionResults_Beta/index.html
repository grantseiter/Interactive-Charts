<p style="text-align:left"> Notes: <br>
	- 'Margin Shift' equals the difference between the electoral margin-of-victory (MOV) in 2020 and in 2016. A positive margin shift represents a shift in votes cast for the Republican candidate and a negative margin shift represents a shift in votes cast for the Democratic candidate. MOV is the difference between the share of votes cast for the winning candidate and the second-place chandidate in an election. For example, if Joe Biden wins the election in Fairfax County, Virginia with 70 percent of the vote and Donald Trump, the second-place finisher, wins 28 percent of the vote, Joe Biden's MOV is equal to - 42. If in 2016, Hillary Clinton won in Fairfax with MOV equal to -36, then the margin shift for Fairfax County would be equal to - 6.  <br>
	- 'Rep Hold' == A Republican won the county in both 2020 and 2016. <br>
	- 'Dem Hold' == A Democrat won the county in both 2020 and 2016. <br>
	- 'Flip to Dem' == A Republican won the county in 2016 and a Democrat won in 2020. <br>
	- 'Flip to Rep' == A Democrat won the county in both 2016 and a Republican won in 2020. <br> </p>
